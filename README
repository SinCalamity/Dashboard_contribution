Problems As of Now:

1) Registration or Sign Up Page/Form is somehow broken [http://127.0.0.1:8000/PayZone/register/] [I FEEL LIKE THERE'S ALOT OF ACTIONS MISSING THAT'S WHY IT DOESN'T WORK].
   After the information needed in the Sign Up form was filled out and I finally clicked the Sign Up button, it didn't redirect me to the Log-In page.
   Hence, the Sign Up page remains after such actions, plus the filled-in information from text boxes disappeared.
   Not only that, but it also didn't save the data for the account I have tried to create [I KNEW, BECAUSE I CHECKED THE DJANGO ADMIN SITE > USERS, AND I CAN'T SEEMINGLY FIND THE ACCOUNT THAT I'VE TRIED TO CREATE].

   1st NOTE: Since the Sign Up Page is currently broken, I've tried to skip the Sign Up page and went to the Login Page to test it; I used the account I've created [FROM THE COMMAND CREATESUPERUSER].
         And somehow it worked and redirected me to my home_dashboard.html.

   2nd NOTE: Base on my research; I've added some lines @settings.py @line 124 onwards related about the Sign Up and Log In page.

   "Solutions I've tried so far"
    a. I already did a lot of research about this problem [I'VE TRIED GOOGLE STACKOVERFLOW, YOUTUBE, CHATGPT, ETC]; But I did not manage to fix it :').

2) I can't manage to show the icons specifically for password icons in my login and register HTMLs, although my show/hide function works by integrating and using bootstrap sources.
   But somehow the icons don't show up.

   "Solutions I've tried so far"
    a. I've tried different approaches, but I end up being on a loop and did not manage to fix it.

3) How do I make our home page urls [home_web.html in this case] from http://127.0.0.1:8000/PayZone into http://127.0.0.1:8000/PayZone?

   "Solutions I've tried so far"
    a. I've tried different approaches, but I always end up in getting page not found.

===========================================Xx
4) The [background-image: url('{% static "/../PayZone/images/bg.jpg" %}');] under PayZone>images>bg.jpg doesn't work anymore.
   It used to work perfectly fine before.

   "Solutions I've tried so far"
    I believe it's correct and should be working fine, just like before. I currently have no idea how to fix it.
